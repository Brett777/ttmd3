      "detailed_summary": "This Provincial Report Card is an essential academic document for Easton David Olmstead, a Grade 9 student at Maplewood Secondary School, which falls under the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. It provides a comprehensive overview of Easton's academic performance during the second semester, first term of the 2024-2025 academic year. The report card is dated April 28, 2025, and outlines Easton's grades and learning skills for five courses: Repertoire, Building the Entrepreneurial Mindset, Exploring Canadian Geography, Mathematics, and Science.\n\nEach course section includes percentage marks, course medians, and qualitative assessments of learning skills, covering areas such as Responsibility, Independent Work, Initiative, Organization, Collaboration, and Self-Regulation. Teachers have provided detailed comments on Easton's strengths and areas where he can improve, and have requested interviews with Easton's parents to discuss his academic progress further. This indicates a proactive approach to address any academic concerns and to support Easton's educational development.\n\nThe document also includes Easton's attendance records, noting the number of classes missed and times he was late, which could provide insights into his engagement with the school. Additionally, the report card is signed by the school's principal, Krista Hudson, and offers instructions for parents and students to retain the report for future reference. It is a crucial document that will be stored in Easton's Ontario Student Record for five years after he leaves school.\n\nFurthermore, the report card offers explanations of how to interpret the percentage marks and includes definitions for specific educational terms like ESL/ELD, IEP, and SHSM. This ensures that parents and guardians can fully understand the content and implications of the report card. Contact information for the school and school board is also provided, facilitating easy communication with educational authorities.",
