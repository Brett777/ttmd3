      "detailed_summary": "NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1 is a critical document that offers detailed guidelines for media sanitization to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Authored by experts from the Computer Security Division of NIST, it provides methods and techniques to ensure data is rendered irretrievable from storage media. The document aligns with federal standards such as FISMA and OMB Circular A-130, making it a vital resource for federal agencies, while also being intended for voluntary use by other organizations and individuals. Published in December 2014, it is available online for free, supporting widespread access and implementation.\n\nThe guidelines are essential in the context of evolving storage technologies and distributed data architectures, which present new challenges for data security. NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 discusses various sanitization methods, including Clear, Purge, and Destroy, applicable to media types such as hard disks, optical media, and flash memory. It highlights the significance of categorizing information based on confidentiality levels to determine appropriate sanitization techniques. The document also addresses roles and responsibilities, decision-making processes, and includes appendices with additional resources and tools for effective implementation.\n\nMedia sanitization is crucial for preventing unauthorized data disclosure, particularly during system disposal and transfer phases. The document emphasizes the need for verification of sanitization methods to ensure effectiveness, especially with emerging techniques like Cryptographic Erase. It provides frameworks for error handling and verification challenges associated with cryptographic methods, ensuring that organizations can trust the sanitization processes they implement. Additionally, the document offers guidance on documentation and certification of sanitization efforts, enhancing transparency and accountability.\n\nNIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 also explores the importance of understanding media characteristics, such as coercivity and encryption capabilities, to tailor sanitization methods effectively. It advises organizations to consult manufacturer guidelines and public forums to share best practices and stay informed about technological advancements. The appendices include a glossary of terms, a bibliography of related resources, and sample forms, offering comprehensive support for organizations aiming to secure data confidentiality through media sanitization.",

Data may pass through multiple \norganizations, systems, and storage media in its lifetime. The pervasive nature of data \npropagation is only increasing as the Internet and data storage systems move towards a \ndistributed cloud-based architecture. As a result, more parties than ever are responsible for \neffectively sanitizing media and the potential is substantial for sensitive data to be collected and \nretained on the media. This responsibility is not limited to those organizations that are the \noriginators or final resting places of sensitive data, but also intermediaries who transiently store \nor process the information along the way. The efficient and effective management of information \nfrom inception through disposition is the responsibility of all those who have handled the data. \nThe application of sophisticated access controls and encryption help reduce the likelihood that an \nattacker can gain direct access to sensitive information. As a result, parties attempting to obtain \nsensitive information may seek to focus their efforts on alternative access means such as \nretrieving residual data on media that has left an organization without sufficient sanitization \neffort having been applied. Consequently, the application of effective sanitization techniques and \ntracking of storage media are critical aspects of ensuring that sensitive data is effectively \nprotected by an organization against unauthorized disclosure. Protection of information is \nparamount. That information may be on paper, optical, electronic or magnetic media. \nAn organization may choose to dispose of media by charitable donation, internal or external \ntransfer, or by recycling it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations if the media is \nobsolete or no longer usable. Even internal transfers require increased scrutiny, as legal and \nethical obligations make it more important than ever to protect data such as Personally \nIdentifiable Information (PII). No matter what the final intended destination of the media is, it is \nimportant that the organization ensure that no easily re-constructible residual representation of \nthe data is stored on the media after it has left the control of the organization or is no longer \ngoing to be protected at the confidentiality categorization of the data stored on the media.   \nSanitization refers to a process that renders access to target data on the media infeasible for a \ngiven level of effort. This guide will assist organizations and system owners in making practical \nsanitization decisions based on the categorization of confidentiality of their information. It does \nnot, and cannot, specifically address all known types of media; however, the described \nsanitization decision process can be applied universally.  \n \n \niv \n \n"

The issue of media disposal and sanitization is \ndriven by the information placed intentionally or unintentionally on the media. Electronic media \nused on a system should be assumed to contain information commensurate with the security \ncategorization of the system\u2019s confidentiality. If not handled properly, release of these media \ncould lead to an occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Categorization of an \ninformation technology (IT) system in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard \n(FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information \nSystems1, is the critical first step in understanding and managing system information and media. \nBased on the results of categorization, the system owner should refer to NIST Special \nPublication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information \nSystems and Organizations2, which specifies that \u201cthe organization sanitizes information system \ndigital media using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. The organization tracks, \ndocuments, and verifies media sanitization and destruction actions and periodically tests \nsanitization equipment/procedures to ensure correct performance. The organization sanitizes or \ndestroys information system digital media before its disposal or release for reuse outside the \norganization, to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to and using the \ninformation contained on the media.\u201d \nThis document will assist organizations in implementing a media sanitization program with \nproper and applicable techniques and controls for sanitization and disposal decisions, considering \nthe security categorization of the associated system\u2019s confidentiality. \nThe objective of this special publication is to assist with decision making when media require \ndisposal, reuse, or will be leaving the effective control of an organization. Organizations should \ndevelop and use local policies and procedures in conjunction with this guide to make effective, \nrisk-based decisions on the ultimate sanitization and/or disposition of media and information. \nThe information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and \napplications. It also provides guidance for information disposition, sanitization, and control \ndecisions to be made throughout the system life cycle. Forms of media exist that are not \naddressed by this guide, and media are yet to be developed and deployed that are not covered by \nthis guide. In those cases, the intent of this guide outlined in the procedures section applies to all \nforms of media based on the evaluated security categorization of the system\u2019s confidentiality \naccording to FIPS 199. \n1 Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal \nInformation and Information Systems, February 2004, 13 pp. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html#199.  \n2 NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and \nOrganizations, April 2013 (includes updates as of January 15, 2014), 460 pp. http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4. \n 1 \n                                                 \n"

This consultation is to ensure compliance \nwith record retention regulations and requirements in the Federal Records Act. In addition, \norganizational management should also be consulted to ensure that historical information is \ncaptured and maintained where required by business needs. This should be ongoing, as controls \nmay have to be adjusted as the system and its environment changes. \n1.2 Audience \nProtecting the confidentiality of information should be a concern for everyone, from federal \nagencies and businesses to home users. Recognizing that interconnections and information \nexchange are critical in the delivery of government services, this guide can be used to assist in \ndeciding what processes to use for sanitization or disposal. \n1.3 Assumptions \nThe premise of this guide is that organizations are able to correctly identify the appropriate \ninformation categories, confidentiality impact levels, and location of the information. Ideally, \nthis activity is accomplished in the earliest phase of the system life cycle.3 This critical initial \nstep is outside the scope of this document, but without this identification, the organization will, \nin all likelihood, lose control of some media containing sensitive information. \nThis guide does not claim to cover all possible media that an organization could use to store \ninformation, nor does it attempt to forecast the future media that may be developed during the \neffective life of this guide. Users are expected to make sanitization and disposal decisions based \non the security categorization of the information contained on the media. \n1.4 Relationship to Other NIST Documents \nThe following NIST documents, including FIPS and Special Publications, are directly related to \nthis document: \n\uf0a7 FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 Revision 1, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and \nInformation Systems to Security Categories4, provide guidance for establishing the \nsecurity categorization for a system\u2019s confidentiality. This categorization will impact the \nlevel of assurance an organization should require in making sanitization decisions.   \n3 NIST SP 800-64 Revision 2, Security Considerations in the Systems Development Life Cycle, October 2008, 67 pp. \nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-64. \n4 NIST SP 800-60 Revision 1, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories, \nAugust 2008, 2 vols. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-60. \n 2 \n                                                 \n"

Hard copy media are physical representations of information, most often \nassociated with paper printouts. However, printer and facsimile ribbons, drums, and \nplatens are all examples of hard copy media. The supplies associated with producing \npaper printouts are often the most uncontrolled. Hard copy materials containing sensitive \ndata that leave an organization without effective sanitization expose a significant \nvulnerability to \u201cdumpster divers\u201d and overcurious employees, risking unwanted \ninformation disclosures. \n\uf0a7 Electronic (i.e., \u201csoft copy\u201d). Electronic media are devices containing bits and bytes \nsuch as hard drives, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), disks, \nflash memory, memory devices, phones, mobile computing devices, networking devices, \noffice equipment, and many other types listed in Appendix A. \nIn the future, organizations will be using media types not specifically addressed by this guide. \nThe processes described in this document should guide media sanitization decision making \nregardless of the type of media in use. To effectively use this guide for all media types, \norganizations and individuals should focus on the information that could possibly have been \nrecorded on the media, rather than on the media itself. \n2.3 Trends in Data Storage Media \nHistorical efforts to sanitize magnetic media have benefitted from the wide use of a single \ncommon type of storage medium implemented relatively similarly across vendors and models. \nThe storage capacity of magnetic media has increased at a relatively constant rate and vendors \nhave modified the technology as necessary to achieve higher capacities. As the technology \napproaches the superparamagnetic limit, or the limit at which magnetic state can be changed with \nexisting media and recording approaches, additional new approaches and technologies will be \nnecessary in order for storage vendors to produce higher capacity devices. \nAlternative technologies such as flash memory-based storage devices, or Solid State Drives \n(SSDs), have also become prevalent due to falling costs, higher performance, and shock \nresistance. SSDs have already begun changing the norm in storage technology, and\u2014at least \nfrom a sanitization perspective\u2014the change is revolutionary (as opposed to evolutionary). \nDegaussing, a fundamental way to sanitize magnetic media, no longer applies in most cases for \nflash memory-based devices. Evolutionary changes in magnetic media will also have potential \nimpacts on sanitization. New storage technologies, and even variations of magnetic storage, that \nare dramatically different from legacy magnetic media will clearly require sanitization research \nand require a reinvestigation of sanitization procedures to ensure efficacy.  \nBoth revolutionary and evolutionary changes make sanitization decisions more difficult, as the \nstorage device may not clearly indicate what type of media is used for data storage. The burden \nfalls on the user to accurately determine the media type and apply the associated sanitization \nprocedure. \n 6 \n"

One major drawback of relying solely upon the native \nRead and Write interface for performing the overwrite procedure is that areas not currently \nmapped to active Logical Block Addressing (LBA) addresses (e.g., defect areas and currently \nunallocated space) are not addressed. Dedicated sanitize commands support addressing these \nareas more effectively. The use of such commands results in a tradeoff because although they \nshould more thoroughly address all areas of the media, using these commands also requires trust \nand assurance from the vendor that the commands have been implemented as expected. \nUsers who have become accustomed to relying upon overwrite techniques on magnetic media \nand who have continued to apply these techniques as media types evolved (such as to flash \nmemory-based devices) may be exposing their data to increased risk of unintentional disclosure.  \nAlthough the host interface (e.g. Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) or Small Computer \nSystem Interface (SCSI)) may be the same (or very similar) across devices with varying \nunderlying media types, it is critical that the sanitization techniques are carefully matched to the \nmedia.   \nDestructive techniques for some media types may become more difficult or impossible to apply \nin the future. Traditional techniques such as degaussing (for magnetic media) become more \ncomplicated as magnetic media evolves, because some emerging variations of magnetic \nrecording technologies incorporate media with higher coercivity (magnetic force). As a result, \nexisting degaussers may not have sufficient force to effectively degauss such media. \nApplying destructive techniques to electronic storage media (e.g., flash memory) is also \nbecoming more challenging, as the necessary particle size for commonly applied grinding \ntechniques goes down proportionally to any increases in flash memory storage density. Flash \nmemory chips already present challenges with occasional damage to grinders due to the hardness \nof the component materials, and this problem will get worse as grinders attempt to grind the \nchips into even smaller pieces. \nCryptographic Erase (CE), as described in Section 2.6, is an emerging sanitization technique that \ncan be used in some situations when data is encrypted as it is stored on media. With CE, media \nsanitization is performed by sanitizing the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the data, as \nopposed to sanitizing the storage locations on media containing the encrypted data itself. CE \ntechniques are typically capable of sanitizing media very quickly and could support partial \nsanitization, a technique where a subset of storage media is sanitization. Partial sanitization, \nsometimes referred to as selective sanitization, has potential applications in cloud computing and \nmobile devices. However, operational use of CE today presents some challenges. In some cases, \nit may be difficult to verify that CE has effectively sanitized media. This challenge, and possible \napproaches, is described in Section 4.7.3. If verification cannot be performed, organizations \nshould use alternative sanitization methods that can be verified, or use CE in combination with a \nsanitization technique that can be verified. \nA list of device-specific characteristics of interest for the application of sanitization techniques is \n 7 \n"

Critical factors affecting information disposition and media sanitization are decided at the \nstart of a system\u2019s development. The initial system requirements should include hardware and \nsoftware specifications as well as interconnections and data flow documents that will assist the \nsystem owner in identifying the types of media used in the system. Some storage devices support \nenhanced commands for sanitization, which may make sanitization easier, faster, and/or more \neffective. The decision may be even more fundamental, because effective sanitization procedures \nmay not yet have been determined for emerging media types. Without an effective command or \ninterface-based sanitization technique, the only option left may be to destroy the media. In that \nevent, the media cannot be reused by other organizations that might otherwise have been able to \nbenefit from receiving the repurposed storage device. \nA determination should be made during the requirements phase about what other types of media \nwill be used to create, capture, or transfer information used by the system. This analysis, \nbalancing business needs and risk to confidentiality, will formalize the media that will be \nconsidered for the system to conform to FIPS 200. \nMedia sanitization and information disposition activity is usually most intense during the \ndisposal phase of the system life cycle. However, throughout the life of an information system, \nmany types of media, containing data, will be transferred outside the positive control of the \norganization. This activity may be for maintenance reasons, system upgrades, or during a \nconfiguration update. \n2.1 Need for Proper Media Sanitization and Information Disposition \nMedia sanitization is one key element in assuring confidentiality. Confidentiality is defined as \n\u201cpreserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for \nprotecting personal privacy and proprietary information\u2026\u201d10 Additionally, \u201ca loss of \nconfidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.\u201d11 \nIn order for organizations to have appropriate controls on the information they are responsible \nfor safeguarding, they must properly safeguard used media. An often rich source of illicit \ninformation collection is either through dumpster diving for improperly disposed hard copy \nmedia, acquisition of improperly sanitized electronic media, or through keyboard and laboratory \nreconstruction of media sanitized in a manner not commensurate with the confidentiality of its \ninformation. Media flows in and out of organizational control through recycle bins in paper form, \nout to vendors for equipment repairs, and hot swapped into other systems in response to \nhardware or software failures. This potential vulnerability can be mitigated through proper \nunderstanding of where information is located, what that information is, and how to protect it. \n10 \u201cDefinitions,\u201d Title 44 U.S.Code, Sec. 3542. 2006 ed.

These characteristics can be used to drive the types of questions that \nmedia users should ask vendors, but ideally this information would be made readily available by \nvendors so that it can be easily retrieved by users to facilitate informed risk based sanitization \ndecisions. For example, knowing the coercivity of the media can help a user decide whether or \nnot the available degausser(s) can effectively degauss the media. \n2.5 Types of Sanitization \nRegarding sanitization, the principal concern is ensuring that data is not unintentionally released. \nData is stored on media, which is connected to a system. This guidance focuses on the media \nsanitization component, which is simply data sanitization applied to a representation of the data \nas stored on a specific media type. Other potential concern areas exist as part of the system, such \nas for monitors, which may have sensitive data burned into the screen. Sensitive data stored in \nareas of the system other than storage media (such as on monitor screens) are not addressed by \nthis document. \nWhen media is repurposed or reaches end of life, the organization executes the system life cycle \nsanitization decision for the information on the media. For example, a mass-produced \ncommercial software program contained on a DVD in an unopened package is unlikely to \ncontain confidential data. Therefore, the decision may be made to simply dispose of the media \nwithout applying any sanitization technique. Alternatively, an organization is substantially more \nlikely to decide that a hard drive from a system that processed PII needs sanitization prior to \nDisposal. \nDisposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no \nimpact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would \nnot result in financial loss or harm to any individuals. \nThe security categorization of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should \ndrive the decisions on how to deal with the media.  The key is to first think in terms of \ninformation confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type. \nIn organizations, information exists that is not associated with any categorized system. This \ninformation is often hard copy internal communications such as memoranda, white papers, and \npresentations. Sometimes this information may be considered sensitive. Examples may include \ninternal disciplinary letters, financial or salary negotiations, or strategy meeting minutes. \nOrganizations should label these media with their internal operating confidentiality levels and \nassociate a type of sanitization described in this publication. \nSanitization is a process to render access to target data (the data subject to the sanitization \ntechnique) on the media infeasible for a given level of recovery effort. The level of effort applied \nwhen attempting to retrieve data may range widely. For example, a party may attempt simple \nkeyboard attacks without the use of specialized tools, skills, or knowledge of the media \ncharacteristics. On the other end of the spectrum, a party may have extensive capabilities and be \nable to apply state of the art laboratory techniques. \n 8 \n"

The categories of \nsanitization are defined as follows: \n\uf0a7 Clear applies logical techniques to sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations \nfor protection against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques; typically applied \nthrough the standard Read and Write commands to the storage device, such as by \nrewriting with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the factory state \n(where rewriting is not supported).   \n\uf0a7 Purge applies physical or logical techniques that render Target Data recovery infeasible \nusing state of the art laboratory techniques.   \n\uf0a7 Destroy renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory \ntechniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data. \nA more detailed summary of sanitization techniques is provided in Section 5. Sanitization \nrequirements for specific media/device types are provided in Appendix A. \nIt is suggested that the user of this guide categorize the information, assess the nature of the \nmedium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the future plans \nfor the media. Then, the organization can choose the appropriate type(s) of sanitization. The \nselected type(s) should be assessed as to cost, environmental impact, etc., and a decision should \nbe made that best mitigates the risk to confidentiality and best satisfies other constraints imposed \non the process. \n2.6 Use of Cryptography and Cryptographic Erase \nMany storage manufacturers have released storage devices with integrated encryption and access \ncontrol capabilities, also known as Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs). SEDs feature always-on \nencryption that substantially reduces the likelihood that unencrypted data is inadvertently \nretained on the device. The end user cannot turn off the encryption capabilitieswhich ensures that \nall data in the designated areas are encrypted. A significant additional benefit of SEDs is the \nopportunity to tightly couple the controller and storage media so that the device can directly \naddress the location where any cryptographic keys are stored, whereas solutions that depend only \non the abstracted user access interface through software may not be able to directly address those \nareas. \nSEDs typically encrypt all of the user-addressable area, with the potential exception of certain \nclearly identified areas, such as those dedicated to the storage of pre-boot applications and \nassociated data. \nCryptographic Erase (CE) leverages the encryption of target data by enabling sanitization of the \ntarget data\u2019s encryption key. This leaves only the ciphertext remaining on the media, effectively \nsanitizing the data by preventing read-access. \nWithout the encryption key used to encrypt the target data, the data is unrecoverable. The level \nof effort needed to decrypt this information without the encryption key then is the lesser of the \n 9 \n"

While there may be situations where use of CE with software cryptographic \nmodules is both appropriate and advantageous, such as performing a quick remote wipe on a \nlost mobile device, unless the organization has confidence in both the protection of the \nencryption keys, and the destruction of all copies of those keys in the sanitization process, \nCE should be used in combination with another appropriate sanitization method. \nSanitization using CE should not be trusted on devices that have been backed-up or \nescrowed the key(s) unless the organization has a high level of confidence about how and \nwhere the keys were stored and managed outside the device. Such back-up or escrowed \ncopies of data, credentials, or keys should be the subject of a separate device sanitization \npolicy. That policy should address backups or escrowed copies within the scope of the \ndevices on which they are actually stored. \nA list of applicable considerations, and a sample for how vendors could report the \nmechanisms implemented, is included in Appendix E.  Users seeking to implement CE \nshould seek reasonable assurance from the vendor (such as the vendor\u2019s report as described \nin Appendix E) that the considerations identified here have been addressed and only use \nFIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules. \n2.7 Factors Influencing Sanitization and Disposal Decisions \nSeveral factors should be considered along with the security categorization of the system \nconfidentiality when making sanitization decisions. The cost versus benefit tradeoff of a \nsanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. For instance, it may not be \ncost-effective to degauss inexpensive media such as diskettes. Even though Clear or Purge may \nbe the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and \nverification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. Organizations retain \nthe ability increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an \nassessment of the existing risk. \nOrganizations should consider environmental factors including (but not limited to): \n\uf0a7 What types (e.g., optical non-rewritable, magnetic) and size (e.g., megabyte, gigabyte, \nand terabyte) of media storage does the organization require to be sanitized? \n\uf0a7 What is the confidentiality requirement for the data stored on the media? \n 11 \n"

However, in some cases, there may be a desire or need to sanitize a subset of the media. \nPartial sanitization comes with some risk, as it may be difficult to verify that sensitive data stored \non a portion of the media did not spill over into other areas of the media (e.g., remapped bad \nblocks). In addition, the dedicated interfaces provided by storage device vendors for sanitization \ntypically operate at the device level, and are not able to be applied to a subset of the media. As a \nresult, partial sanitization usually depends on the typical read and write commands available to \nthe user, which may not be able to bypass any interface abstraction that may be present in order \nto directly address the media area of concern. \nOn some storage devices featuring integrated encryption capabilities, CE provides a unique \nmechanism for supporting some forms of partial sanitization. Some of these devices support the \nability to encrypt portions of the data with different encryption keys (e.g., encrypting different \npartitions with different encryption keys). When the interface supports sanitizing only a subset of \nthe encryption keys, partial sanitization via CE is possible. As with any other sanitization \ntechnique applied to media, the level of assurance depends both upon vendor implementation and \non the level of assurance that data was stored only in the areas that are able to be reliably \nsanitized. Data may be stored outside these regions either because the user or software on the \nsystem moved data outside of the designated area on the media, or because the storage device \nstored data to the media in a manner not fully understood by the user. \nDue to the difficulty in reliably ensuring that partial sanitization effectively addresses all \nsensitive data, sanitization of the whole device is preferred to partial sanitization whenever \npossible. Organizations should understand the potential risks to this approach and make \nappropriate decisions on this technique balancing the factors described earlier in this sectionas \n13 NIST SP 800-36, Guide to Selecting Information Technology Security Products, October 2003, 67 pp. \nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-36. \n \n 12 \n                                                 \n"

This information is typically documented in a \u2018statement of volatility\u2019. \nThe statement may be used to support decisions about which equipment to purchase, based on \nthe ease or difficulty of sanitization. While volatility statements are useful, caution should be \napplied in comparing statements across vendors because vendors may state volatility details \ndifferently.   \nOrganizations should take care in identifying media for sanitization. Many items used will \ncontain multiple forms of media that may require different methods of sanitization. For example, \na desktop computer may contain a hard drive, motherboard, RAM, and ROM, and mobile \ndevices contain on-board volatile memory as well as nonvolatile removable memory.  \nThe increasing availability of rapidly applicable techniques, such as Cryptographic Erase, \nprovides opportunities for organizations to reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure by \ncombining sanitization technologies and techniques. For example, an organization could choose \nto apply Cryptographic Erase at a user\u2019s desktop before removing the media to send it to be \n\u2018formally\u2019 sanitized at the sanitization facility, in order to reduce risk and exposure. \n4.2 Determination of Security Categorization \nEarly in the system life cycle, a system is categorized using the guidance found in FIPS 199, \nNIST SP 800-60 Rev. 1, or CNSSI 125318, including the security categorization for the system\u2019s \nconfidentiality. This security categorization is revisited at least every three years (or when \nsignificant change occurs within the system) and revalidated throughout the system\u2019s life, and \nany necessary changes to the confidentiality category can be made. Once the security \ncategorization is completed, the system owner can then design a sanitization process that will \nensure adequate protection of the system\u2019s information. \nMuch information is not associated with a specific system but is associated with internal business \ncommunications, usually on paper. Organizations should label these media with their internal \noperating confidentiality levels and associate a type of sanitization described in this publication. \n4.3 Reuse of Media \nA key decision on sanitization is whether the media are planned for reuse or recycle. Some forms \nof media are often reused to conserve an organization\u2019s resources. \nIf media are not intended for reuse either within or outside an organization due to damage or \nother reason, the simplest and most cost-effective method of control may be Destroy. \n18 Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253, Security Categorization and Control Selection for \nNational Security Systems, March 27, 2014. https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm. \n 18 \n                                                 \n"

If the organization is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser or a dedicated \nworkstation), then equipment calibration, as well as equipment testing, and scheduled \nmaintenance, is also needed. \n4.7.2 Verification of Personnel Competencies \nAnother key element is the potential training needs and current expertise of personnel \nconducting the sanitization. Organizations should ensure that equipment operators are \ncompetent to perform sanitization functions. \n4.7.3 Verification of Sanitization Results \nThe goal of sanitization verification is to ensure that the target data was effectively sanitized. \nWhen supported by the device interface (such as an ATA or SCSI storage device or solid \nstate drive), the highest level of assurance of effective sanitization (outside of a laboratory) \nis typically achieved by a full reading of all accessible areas to verify that the expected \nsanitized value is in all addressable locations. A full verification should be performed if time \nand external factors permit. This manner of verification typically only applies where the \ndevice is in an operational state following sanitization so that data can be read and written \nthrough the native interface. \nIf an organization chooses representative sampling then there are three main goals applied to \nelectronic media sanitization verification: \n1. Select pseudorandom locations on the media each time the analysis tool is applied. \nThis reduces the likelihood that a sanitization tool that only sanitizes a subset of the \nmedia will result in verification success in a situation where sensitive data still \nremains. \n2. Select locations across the addressable space (user addressable and reserved areas). \nFor instance, conceptually break the media up into equally sized subsections. Select \na large enough number of subsections so that the media is well-covered. The number \nof practical subsections depends on the device and addressing scheme. The \nsuggested minimum number of subsections for a storage device leveraging LBA \n 20 \n"

This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may \nbe transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be \nreused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control: \nUnder Organization Control: \n\uf0a7 Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under organization control \nif contractual agreements are in place with the organization and the maintenance provider \nspecifically provides for the confidentiality of the information. \n\uf0a7 Maintenance being performed on an organization\u2019s site, under the organization\u2019s \nsupervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the \norganization. \nNot Under Organization Control (External Control): \n\uf0a7 Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where \nthe specific media will not be returned to the organization are considered to be out of \norganizational control. \n4.5 Data Protection Level \nEven within an organization, varying data protection policies may be established. For instance, a \ncompany may have an engineering department and a sales department. The sales personnel may \nnot have a need for access to the detailed proprietary technical data such as source code and \nschematics, and the engineers may not have a need to access the PII of the company\u2019s customers. \nBoth might be within the same confidentiality categorization, but contextually different and with \ndifferent internal and external rules regarding necessary controls. As such, data protection level \nis a complementary consideration to organizational control. When identifying whether \nsanitization is necessary, both the organizational control and data protection level should be \nconsidered. \n4.6 Sanitization and Disposal Decision \nOnce an organization completes an assessment of its system confidentiality, determines the need \nfor information sanitization, determines appropriate time frames for sanitization, and determines \nthe types of media used and the media disposition, an effective, risk-based decision can be made \non the appropriate and needed level of sanitization. Again, environmental factors and media type \nmight cause the level of sanitization to change. For example, purging paper copies generally does \nnot make sense, so destroying them would be an acceptable alternative. \nUpon completion of sanitization decision making, the organization should record the decision \nand ensure that a process and proper resources are in place to support these decisions. This \nprocess is often the most difficult piece of the media sanitization process because it includes not \nonly the act of sanitization but also the verification: capturing decisions and actions, identifying \nresources, and having critical interfaces with key officials. \n 19 \n"

Four of the most common are presented \nin this section. Users of this guide should categorize the information to be disposed of, assess the \nnature of the medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the \nfuture plans for the media. Then, using information in Table 5-1, decide on the appropriate \nmethod for sanitization. The selected method should be assessed as to cost, environmental \nimpact, etc., and a decision should be made that best mitigates the risks to an unauthorized \ndisclosure of information. \n \nTable 5-1: Sanitization Methods \nMethod \nDescription \nClear \nOne method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite user-\naddressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data, using the standard read \nand write commands for the device. This process may include overwriting not only the logical \nstorage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also should include all user-\naddressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting process is to replace Target Data \nwith non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are damaged or not \nrewriteable, and may not address all areas of the device where sensitive data may be \nretained. The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable \nsanitization method.  For example, flash memory-based storage devices may contain spare \ncells and perform wear levelling, making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data \nusing this approach because the device may not support directly addressing all areas where \nsensitive data has been stored using the native read and write interface. \nThe Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage devices, where \nthe device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment) only provides the ability to \nreturn the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting the file pointers) and does not directly \nsupport the ability to rewrite or apply media-specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents.  \nWhere rewriting is not supported, manufacturer resets and procedures that do not include rewriting \nmight be the only option to Clear the device and associated media.  These still meet the definition \nfor Clear as long as the device interface available to the user does not facilitate retrieval of the \nCleared data. \nPurge \nSome methods of purging (which vary by media and must be applied with considerations \ndescribed further throughout this document) include overwrite, block erase, and \nCryptographic Erase, through the use of dedicated, standardized device sanitize commands \nthat apply media-specific techniques to bypass the abstraction inherent in typical read and \nwrite commands. \nDestructive techniques also render the device Purged when effectively applied to the \nappropriate media type, including incineration, shredding, disintegrating, degaussing, and \npulverizing.  The common benefit across all these approaches is assurance that the data is \ninfeasible to recover using state of the art laboratory techniques. However, Bending, Cutting, \nand the use of some emergency procedures (such as using a firearm to shoot a hole through \na storage device) may only damage the media as portions of the media may remain \nundamaged and therefore accessible using advanced laboratory techniques. \nDegaussing renders a Legacy Magnetic Device Purged when the strength of the degausser is \ncarefully matched to the media coercivity.  Coercivity may be difficult to determine based only on \ninformation provided on the label.  Therefore, refer to the device manufacturer for coercivity details.  \nDegaussing should never be solely relied upon for flash memory-based storage devices or for \nmagnetic storage devices that also contain non-volatile non-magnetic storage.

Even when a \ndedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to \nreliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place.  Any configuration \noptions limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be \nreset prior to applying the sanitization technique.

The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase \ndepends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.   \nGiven the variability in implementation of the Enhanced Secure Erase feature, use of this \ncommand is not recommended without first referring the manufacturer to identify that the storage \ndevice\u2019s model-specific implementation meets the needs of the organization. \nWhereas ATA Secure Erase was a Purge mechanism for magnetic media, it is only a Clear \nmechanism for flash memory due to variability in implementation and the possibility that sensitive \ndata may remain in areas such as spare cells that have been rotated out of use. \nDegaussing must not be solely relied upon as a sanitization technique on flash memory-based \nstorage devices or on hybrid devices that contain non-volatile flash memory storage media.  \nDegaussing may be used when non-volatile flash memory media is present if the flash memory \ncomponents are sanitized using media-dependent techniques. \nSCSI Solid State  Drives (SSSDs) This includes Parallel SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre \nChannel, USB Attached Storage (UAS), and SCSI Express. \nClear: \nOverwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting \ntechnologies/methods/tools.

The assurance provided by degaussing \ndepends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it appropriately and periodically spot \nchecking the results to ensure it is working as expected. \nWhen using the three pass SCSI sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert (also known as \ncomplement) option, the verification process would simply search for the original pattern (which \nwould have been written again during the third pass).  While it is widely accepted that one pass \nof overwriting should be sufficient for Purging the data, the availability of a dedicated command \nthat incorporates the ability to invert the data pattern allows an efficient and effective approach \nthat mitigates any residual risk associated with variations in implementations of magnetic \nrecording features across device manufacturers. \nThe storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to \naccess portions of the media, such as \u201cSCSI mode parameter block descriptor\u2019s NUMBER OF \nLOGICAL BLOCKS field (accessible with the SCSI MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT \ncommands\u201d.  Even when a dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their \npresence may affect the ability to reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if \nleft in place.  Any configuration options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of \nthe storage media should be reset prior to applying the sanitization technique.   \nWhen Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional \nsanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following \nCryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully.  A quick \nsampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed \nafter any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase. \nNot all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic \nErase as a Purge mechanism.  The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase \ndepends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D. \nThis guidance applies to Legacy Magnetic media only, and it is critical to verify the media type \nprior to sanitization.

Refer to the TCG and device manufacturers for more \ninformation. \nOptionally:  After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the \noverwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a pseudorandom \npattern across the media.  If the overwrite command is not supported, the Secure \nErase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied following Cryptographic \nErase. \n4. \nDegauss in an organizationally approved automatic degausser or disassemble the hard \ndisk drive and Purge the enclosed platters with an organizationally approved \ndegaussing wand. \nDestroy:   \nShred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator. \nNotes:   \nVerification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge, except degaussing.  \nThe assurance provided by degaussing depends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it \nappropriately and periodically spot checking the results to ensure it is working as expected. \nWhen using the three pass ATA sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert option, the \nverification process would simply search for the original pattern (which would have been written \nagain during the third pass).   \nThe storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to \naccess portions of the media as defined in the ATA standard, such as a Host Protected Area \n(HPA), Device Configuration Overlay (DCO), or Accessible Max Address.  Even when a \ndedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to \nreliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place.  Any configuration \noptions limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be \nreset prior to applying the sanitization technique.  Recovery data, such as an OEM-provided \nrestoration image may have been stored in this manner, and sanitization may therefore impact \nthe ability to recover the system unless reinstallation media is also available. \nWhen Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional \nsanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following \nCryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully.  A quick \nsampling verification as described in section 4.7 should also be performed after any additional \ntechniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase. \nNot all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic \nErase as a Purge mechanism.  The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase \ndepends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.   \nGiven the variability in implementation of the ATA Security feature set SECURITY ERASE UNIT \ncommand, use of this command is not recommended without first consulting with the \nmanufacturer to verify that the storage device\u2019s model-specific implementation meets the needs \nof the organization. \nThis guidance applies to Legacy Magnetic media only, and it is critical to verify the media type \nprior to sanitization.  Note that emerging media types, such as HAMR media or hybrid drives may \nnot be easily identifiable by the label.  Refer to the manufacturer for details about the media type \nin a storage device.   \nDegaussing the media in a storage device typically renders the device unusable. \nSCSI Hard Disk Drives  This includes Parallel SCSI,Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre Channel, USB Attached \nStorage (UAS), and SCSI Express  Partial sanitization is not supported in this section. \nClear:  \nOverwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting \ntechnologies/methods/tools.  The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes \nwith a fixed data value, such as all zeros.  Multiple passes or more complex values may \noptionally be used. \nPurge:   \nFour options are available: \n1. \nApply the SCSI SANITIZE command, if supported.

The result of the block erase command is vendor \nunique, but will likely be 0s or 1s.

Key Generation: Identify whether a Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), such \nas one of those listed in SP 800-90,28 was used, and whether it was validated. \n3. Media Encryption: Identify the algorithm, key strength, mode of operation, and any \napplicable validation(s).   \n4. Key Level and Wrapping: Identify if the MEK (either wrapped with another value or \nnot wrapped) is directly sanitized, or if a key that wraps the MEK (a key encryption key, \nor KEK) is sanitized. A description of the wrapping techniques only applies where a \nKEK (and not the MEK) is sanitized. Wrapping details, when provided, should include \nthe algorithm used, strength, and (if applicable) mode of operation. \n5. Data Areas Addressed: Describe which areas are encrypted and which areas are not \nencrypted. For any unencrypted areas, describe how sanitization is performed. \n6. Key Life Cycle Management: The key(s) on a device may have multiple wrapping \nactivities (wrapping, unwrapping, and rewrapping) throughout the device\u2019s lifecycle. \nIdentify how the key(s) being sanitized are handled during wrapping activities that are \nnot directly part of the Cryptographic Erase operation. For example, a user may have \nreceived an SED that was always encrypting, and simply turned on the authentication \ninterface. Identify how the previous instance of the MEK was sanitized when it was \nwrapped with the user\u2019s authentication credentials. \n7. Key Sanitization Technique: Describe the media-dependent sanitization method for the \nkey being sanitized. Some examples might include one or more inverted overwrite passes \nif the media is magnetic, a block erase for an SSD, or other media-specific techniques for \nother types of media. \n8. Key Escrow or Backup: Identify whether the device supports key escrow or backup. \nIdentify whether the device supports discovery of whether any key(s) at or below the \nlevel of the key escrowed has/have ever been escrowed from or injected into the device.If \nthe MEK  is directly sanitized and only a KEK can be escrowed, clearly identify that fact.   \n9. Error Condition Handling: Identify how the device handles error conditions that \nprevent the Cryptographic Erase operation from fully completing. For example, if the \nlocation where the key was stored cannot be sanitized, does the Cryptographic Erase \noperation report success or failure to the user? \n10. Interface Clarity: Identify which interface commands support the features described in \nthe statement. If the device supports the use of multiple MEKs, identify whether all \nMEKs are changed using the interface commands available and any additional commands \nor actions necessary to ensure all MEKs are changed. Note that under certain conditions, \nnot all MEKs have to be cleared (e.g., partial sanitization of target data). \n28 NIST SP 800-90A (as amended), Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit \nGenerators, January 2012, 136 pp. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-90A. \n 50 \n                                                 \n"
