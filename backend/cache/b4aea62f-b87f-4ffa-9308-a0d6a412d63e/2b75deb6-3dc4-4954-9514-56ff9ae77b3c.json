Easton has demonstrated the ability to fulfill responsibilities and commitments within the learning environment. He has\nnormally submitted assignments and met deadlines. He has developed the ability to plan out his work and follow a process for completing\ntasks at a grade appropriate level. Easton is capable of independently monitoring, assessing and revising plans as required to complete their\ntasks and meet individual goals. He responds positively to the ideas, opinions, values and traditions of others. He is normally a positive\ninfluence when working with others and will resolve conflict to achieve group goals. Easton brings curiosity to the classroom each day and has\na natural interest in learning. He always approaches new tasks with a positive attitude. Easton has demonstrated the determination required\nto persevere through challenges and will make an effort to complete tasks regardless of any setbacks.\nNext Steps:\nEaston had a successful Grade 8 year and has blossomed into a confident young man. A major highlight for him was participating in the\nschool musical and leading a successful club for the entire year. Both activities required commitment and Easton showed he was up to the\ntask. Moving into Grade 9, it will be important for Easton to seek out support when he does not understand the material and ensure he never\nlets a learning gap get too big. He also will need to work to stay on top of his deadlines and stay organized with his materials.\nWishing you all the best in Grade 9, Easton! It was a pleasure teaching you! A.
